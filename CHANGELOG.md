# Change Log - Rush Monodex

<!--
CHANGELOG GUIDANCE:

- When starting new work after publishing, add an `## Unreleased` section
- `###` headings must be one of: Added, Changed, Fixed, Deprecated, Removed, Security
- CHANGELOG.md is for user-facing changes only (implementation details go in your Git commit description)
- Focus on user experience ("Fixed a problem where the crawler sometimes would report X") not implementation ("Added stricter validation in the f() function")
- Avoid jargon and complex sentences; assume your audience is a professional engineer with only superficial knowledge about Monodex

PUBLISHING PROCEDURE:

1. Choose an appropriate version number based on semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Breaking changes that require user action
   - MINOR: New features, backwards compatible
   - PATCH: Bug fixes, backwards compatible

2. Update `version` in Cargo.toml

3. Rename "## Unreleased" to "## X.Y.Z" and add the timestamp (UTC)

4. After publishing, the next PR author will add a new "## Unreleased" section
-->

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **Breaking: switched vector storage from Qdrant to LanceDB**: Monodex now uses LanceDB as an embedded, in-process vector database instead of a separate Qdrant server.
  - No external service to install, run, or configure. The database is a directory on disk.
  - The on-disk format is incompatible with prior versions. Existing users must delete their old Qdrant collection and re-crawl.
  - Removes the `qdrant` section (`url`, `collection`, `maxUploadBytes`) from `config.json`. An old config containing a `qdrant` section will be rejected.

- **Breaking: new `init-db` command, required before first crawl**: Run `monodex init-db` once to create the database. This replaces the old step of provisioning a Qdrant collection.

- **Database location is configurable**: Defaults to `~/.monodex/default-db/`. Set `database.path` in `config.json` to override. The path must be absolute. Tilde expansion (`~`), environment variables (`$VAR`), and relative paths are not supported.

- **Search output now reports distance instead of score**: Lower numbers are better. Output format is `dist=N.NNN`.

- **Tool home moved to `~/.monodex/`**: All monodex state files now live under `~/.monodex/` instead of `~/.config/monodex/`. This provides a consistent location across all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). Set the `MONODEX_HOME` environment variable to override the default location. On first run, if old config files are found at the previous location, monodex prints a warning suggesting migration.

### Added

- **Chunking warning persistence**: Files that require fallback line-based splitting (when AST chunking fails) are now tracked and persisted to `<database>/warnings-<catalog>.json`. The crawl command reports these files with their relative paths and shows a warning count during progress.

- **Documentation updates**: README now shows Configuration before First-Time Setup, correct Rust version (1.93+), and updated debug flag description. DESIGN.md has a new vocabulary orientation, corrected schema documentation, and a current-state error-handling section.

### Fixed

- **Config files now support JSONC (JSON with comments)**: Config files can include `//` line comments, per Rush Stack convention.

- **Example config catalog names**: The example `config.json` now uses valid kebab-case catalog names (`my-monorepo`, `another-monorepo`) instead of invalid underscored names that would fail validation.

## 0.4.0 (2025-01-17)

### Changed

- **Breaking: Stricter identifier validation**: Catalog and label names must now follow strict syntax rules. Catalogs use kebab-case (e.g., `my-repo`). Labels use Git-like identifiers (e.g., `main`, `feature/x`, `release/v1.2.3`). Labels may contain `=` as a permitted separator character (e.g., `branch=main`, `commit=abc123`). These are opaque identifiers today; the `kind=payload` convention is reserved for a future typed-label grammar and is not currently interpreted by Monodex. The Qdrant payload field `label_name` has been renamed to `label`. Existing collections with non-conforming identifiers must be recreated. See [#25](https://github.com/microsoft/monodex/issues/25) for the full syntax specification.

### Added

- **Deterministic embedding memory control**: The `embeddingModel` config section now supports `"auto"` values for `modelInstances` and `threadsPerInstance`, which are computed deterministically from system properties (total RAM, CPU cores, and Linux cgroup limits). This prevents OOM failures on memory-constrained machines while maximizing parallelism on capable hardware.
- **Startup memory warning**: Before embedding begins, monodex prints available RAM and estimated usage (based on resolved config). If the estimate exceeds available RAM, a warning suggests adjusting config values.

### Fixed

- **Cgroup-aware memory warning**: Fixed a bug where memory warnings in containerized environments would compare against host-level available RAM instead of cgroup-limited available RAM. This caused the warning to never fire even when the container was at risk of OOM.
- **Config field mapping**: The `embeddingModel` field in `config.json` is now correctly mapped to the Rust struct via `#[serde(rename = "embeddingModel")]`. Previously, this field was silently ignored due to snake_case/camelCase mismatch.

## 0.3.0

_Released on April 16, 2026 (UTC)_

### Changed

- **crawl command now requires explicit source**: Must specify `--label` AND either `--working-dir` OR `--commit`
  - Previously: `monodex crawl --catalog myrepo --label main` (defaulted to HEAD)
  - Now: `monodex crawl --catalog myrepo --label main --commit HEAD`
  - This prevents accidental overwrites of labels and makes crawl intent explicit
  - CLI now shows proper usage: `monodex crawl --label <LABEL> <--commit <COMMIT>|--working-dir>`

### Fixed

- **Working directory blob IDs now match Git blob IDs**: `--working-dir` mode now uses Git CLI batch commands (`git ls-files`, `git status`, `git hash-object`) to compute blob IDs that respect `.gitattributes`, clean filters, and other repo-specific settings. This ensures identical content produces the same `file_id` in both `--commit` and `--working-dir` modes, enabling proper incremental skipping.

## 0.2.0

_Released on April 14, 2026 (UTC)_

### Updates

- Add `--debug` CLI flag for verbose network request logging
- Add `maxUploadBytes` config setting for Qdrant payload limit (default 30MB)
- Implement rewind upload algorithm for large batch splitting to avoid Qdrant payload limits
- Improve upload error handling: preserve chunks on failure, report clear error messages

## 0.1.0

_Released on April 10, 2026 (UTC)_

### Minor changes

- Add JSON schemas for `config.json`, `monodex-crawl.json`, and `context.json` for IDE autocomplete
- Add user-configurable crawl settings via `monodex-crawl.json` (file types, exclusions, keep patterns)
- Add `--working-dir` flag to index uncommitted changes from the filesystem
- Add label-based indexing: maintain multiple queryable snapshots (branches, commits) within a catalog
- Add `use` command to set default catalog/label context for subsequent commands
- Add Git-based crawling: reads from Git objects, not working tree (deterministic, reproducible)
- Switch to jina-embeddings-v2-base-code model (768 dimensions, 8192 token limit)
- Increase chunk target size from 1800 to 6000 characters

### Patches

- Fix crawl error handling: track and report upload failures, label assignment failures
- Fix `source_uri` path separator on Windows
- Fix catalog validation in `use` command
- Fix race condition in crawl checkpointing
- Increase HTTP timeout for wait=true operations

## 0.0.1
