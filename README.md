**Empower your agent to navigate large codebases.**

Monodex is a standalone developer tool that provides smart, up-to-date codesearch for large monorepos. The CLI is directly usable by humans, but crafted to minimize LLM token cost.

## Key features

- **Simple to install:** Run `cargo install monodex`, create a `~/.monodex/monodex-config.json` (see [Configuration](#configuration) below), then `monodex init-db` to create the database, and you're ready to start crawling.
- **Designed for scale:** Incremental indexing means changes are picked up without re-crawling the whole repo. Ranked search surfaces the most relevant results, instead of dumping every match into your agent's context.
- **Optimized for searching code:** AST-guided chunking and a hybrid of full-text and semantic search, battle-tested on large scale frontend monorepos. (TypeScript today; more languages to come.)
- **Self-contained:** Runs entirely on your own hardware, with no LLM service, no Docker container, and no separate database process. The database can be moved between machines.
- **Agent-agnostic:** CLI output crafted for agent consumption, designed to plug into a variety of coding agents and workflows.
- **Open source:** the core developer tooling everyone relies on should be free, open to inspect, and not gated behind someone else's roadmap.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for what's new.

## Vocabulary

Monodex uses a few terms to describe the containment hierarchy:

- A **database** is the on-disk store: by default `~/.monodex/default-db`. Everything lives here.
- A **catalog** is a named monorepo registered in your config. You might have one catalog per codebase.
- A **label** is a named fileset within a catalog: typically a branch or commit. Searches are scoped to a label.
- A **chunk** is a unit of indexed content (function, class, section).

Hierarchy: **database** › **catalog** › **label** › **chunk**

Monodex supports two **retrieval methods**, normally used together, individually selectable via `--retrieval`:

- `fts`: full-text search over the literal text of each chunk. Use when you know an exact name, identifier, or string and want to find every place it appears.
- `vector`: semantic similarity over learned chunk embeddings ([Jina v2 code model](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code)). Use when you can describe what the code does but don't know what it's called. Catches matches `fts` would miss for lack of vocabulary overlap.

The default `monodex search` queries both and fuses the results by reciprocal rank. Each result line is tagged `[f]`, `[v]`, or `[f+v]` to show which method(s) ranked it.

## Usage Guide

The indexed database is a complete, internally consistent snapshot of the codebase as it existed at crawl time. Searches and views work independent of any local file changes, branches, or whether the repo is even cloned, which makes Monodex more than a replacement for grep: it can be the primary way an agent learns about a codebase.

The intended integration today is via the CLI; agents shell out to `monodex search` and `monodex view` and parse the output. An MCP server is on the backlog.

**Typical workflow:**

1. **Set default context** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   monodex use --catalog rushstack --label main
   ```

2. **Start with search** to find relevant code:

   ```bash
   monodex search --text "how does rush handle pnpm shrinkwrap files"
   ```

3. **View full chunks** using the `file_id:chunk_ordinal` from search results:

   ```bash
   monodex view --id 700a4ba232fe9ddc:3
   ```

4. **Get surrounding context** by viewing adjacent chunks:

   ```bash
   monodex view --id 700a4ba232fe9ddc:2-4
   ```

5. **Reconstruct entire files** by viewing all chunks:

   ```bash
   monodex view --id 700a4ba232fe9ddc
   ```

**Output format:** Code lines are `>`-prefixed to frame chunk content distinctly from result headers and other CLI output.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: 1.93+ (for edition 2024). If you do not already have a Rust toolchain installed, the standard installer is [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). On Linux and macOS, rustup adds `~/.cargo/bin` to your shell's PATH via your shell rc file; restart your shell or run `source ~/.cargo/env` after installing. On Windows, the installer handles PATH automatically. Verify with `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`.

- **Git**: 2.35.0+ (required for working-directory crawls; the `git ls-files --format` flag was introduced in 2.35.0)

- **Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`)**: Required at build time by LanceDB's transitive dependencies. Install via your platform package manager:

  | Platform      | Command                                  |
  | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
  | Windows       | `winget install protobuf`                |
  | macOS         | `brew install protobuf`                  |
  | Debian/Ubuntu | `sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler` |
  | Fedora/RHEL   | `sudo dnf install protobuf-compiler`     |
  | Arch          | `sudo pacman -S protobuf`                |

  Verify with `protoc --version` (any recent 3.x or 4.x/20+ release works). If `protoc` is installed in a non-standard location, set the `PROTOC` environment variable to its full path before building.

- **Model**: jina-embeddings-v2-base-code (auto-downloaded from Hugging Face on first use; cached locally by the `hf_hub` library, typically under `~/.cache/huggingface/`)

## Installation

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install monodex
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/monodex.git
cd monodex
cargo build --release

# Binary will be at ./target/release/monodex
```

## Configuration

Create `~/.monodex/monodex-config.json`:

```js
{
  // Database configuration (optional, defaults shown)
  "database": {
    "path": "./default-db"
  },

  // Catalog definitions (required)
  "catalogs": {
    "sparo": {
      "type": "monorepo",
      "path": "/path/to/sparo"
    },
    "rushstack": {
      "type": "monorepo",
      "path": "/path/to/rushstack"
    }
  },

  // Embedding model configuration (optional, defaults shown)
  "embeddingModel": {
    "modelInstances": "auto",
    "threadsPerInstance": "auto"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** We use the [Sparo](https://github.com/tiktok/sparo) monorepo for development testing, since it's a small open-source Rush monorepo.

**Fields:**

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Field                               | Required | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `catalogs.<name>.type`              | Yes      | Catalog type: `"monorepo"`                                                          |
| `catalogs.<name>.path`              | Yes      | Path to the repository root. May be an absolute path, or a relative path starting with `./` or `../` (resolved against the folder containing monodex-config.json). Tilde (`~`) and environment variables (`$VAR`) are not supported. |
| `database.path`                     | No       | Custom database path (default: `./default-db`, i.e. `<config-folder>/default-db`). May be an absolute path, or a relative path starting with `./` or `../` (resolved against the folder containing monodex-config.json). Tilde (`~`) and environment variables (`$VAR`) are not supported. The path must point to a local filesystem; network filesystems (NFS, SMB) and synced cloud folders (Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, Google Drive) are not supported. |
| `embeddingModel.modelInstances`     | No       | Number of ONNX model instances (default: `"auto"`). Primary driver of memory usage. |
| `embeddingModel.threadsPerInstance` | No       | Threads per model instance (default: `"auto"`). CPU tuning only.                    |

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

**Embedding model configuration:**

The `embeddingModel` section controls memory and CPU usage for embedding generation:

- **`modelInstances`**: Number of ONNX sessions. Each session uses approximately 700MB-1GB for the model weights and runtime, but the auto-detection heuristic plans for 2.5 GB per instance to provide conservative headroom for memory fragmentation, peak usage during inference, and avoiding OOM on memory-constrained systems. Use `"auto"` to automatically size based on available system memory, or an integer ≥ 1 for explicit control.
- **`threadsPerInstance`**: Threads per ONNX session for intra-op parallelism. Use `"auto"` to automatically size based on CPU cores, or an integer ≥ 1 for explicit control.

**Catalog types:**

- **`monorepo`**: Walks upward to find the nearest `package.json` for package name resolution. Breadcrumbs show `@scope/package-name:File.ts:Symbol`.

## First-Time Setup

Before using Monodex, initialize the database:

```bash
monodex init-db
```

This creates a local LanceDB database at `~/.monodex/default-db/`. No external services are required.

## Usage

### Global Options

```bash
# Use a custom config folder location
monodex --config-folder /path/to/config-folder search --text "query"

# Enable verbose debug logging for storage operations
monodex --debug crawl --catalog myrepo --label main --commit HEAD

# Show help for any command
monodex --help
monodex crawl --help

# Show version
monodex --version
```

### Debug Mode

The `--debug` flag enables verbose logging for troubleshooting:

- Logs storage-layer operations
- Shows batch sizes during uploads
- Useful for diagnosing database issues
- Also enables per-result diagnostic continuations on `monodex search` (RRF score, BM25, vector distance); see "Search the Database" below.

Example:

```bash
monodex --debug crawl --catalog sparo --label main --commit HEAD
```

### Label-Based Indexing

A **label** is a named, queryable fileset within a catalog. Labels typically represent branches or specific commits:

- a label named `main` under the `rushstack` catalog (main branch)
- a label named `feature-x` (a feature branch)
- a label named `v1.0.0` (a specific release tag)

**Key concept:** Chunks are immutable content. Labels track which chunks belong to which fileset. When you crawl a new commit under a label, membership is updated but identical content is reused.

### Set Default Context

The `use` command manages the default catalog and label for subsequent commands:

```bash
# Show current context
monodex use

# Set default catalog and label
monodex use --catalog sparo --label main

# Now you can omit --label in subsequent commands
monodex search --text "how to read JSON files"
```

Default context is stored in `~/.monodex/monodex-state.json`. Explicit flags always override defaults.

### Index a Repository

```bash
# Index working directory changes
monodex crawl --catalog rushstack --label working --working-dir

# Index HEAD commit under the "main" label
monodex crawl --catalog rushstack --label main --commit HEAD

# Index a specific branch
monodex crawl --catalog rushstack --label feature-x --commit feature-branch

# Index a specific commit SHA
monodex crawl --catalog rushstack --label v1.0.0 --commit a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Selective crawl: build only the FTS index, narrowing search retrieval to "fts"
# NOTE: drops vector from the label until a future crawl re-includes it
monodex crawl --catalog rushstack --label main --commit HEAD --retrieval fts

# Selective crawl: build only the vector index, narrowing search retrieval to "vector"
# NOTE: drops fts from the label until a future crawl re-includes it
monodex crawl --catalog rushstack --label main --commit HEAD --retrieval vector
```

**Required arguments:** The `crawl` command requires `--label` and either `--working-dir` or `--commit`. This prevents accidental overwrites of important labels.

**Retrieval methods:** Without `--retrieval`, the crawl builds both vector and FTS state for the label. Pass `--retrieval <method>` (repeatable) to limit which methods are built. A subsequent crawl with a different `--retrieval` set narrows or widens the label's retrieval selection. Narrowing is non-destructive on disk (the data stays put until garbage collection) and reversible by re-widening with another crawl.

**Incremental sync:** The crawl is incremental. Unchanged files are skipped. You can safely CTRL+C and resume later.

**Commit-based:** Crawling with `--commit` reads from Git objects, not the working tree. This ensures deterministic, reproducible indexing.

**Working directory mode:** Use `--working-dir` to index uncommitted changes. This reads directly from the filesystem instead of Git objects. Working-directory labels are mutable: re-crawling a working-directory label updates the indexed content for files that changed.

**Label reassignment:** When you re-crawl a label with a new commit, chunks from the old commit that no longer exist are removed from that label's membership.

### Search the Database

```bash
# Hybrid search (default; uses both vector and FTS, fused via reciprocal rank)
monodex search --text "how to read JSON files"

# With explicit catalog and label
monodex search --text "API Extractor" --catalog rushstack --label main --limit 10

# Semantic search only
monodex search --text "how to read JSON files" --retrieval vector

# Lexical full-text search only
monodex search --text "JsonFile.load" --retrieval fts

# With per-result diagnostic detail (RRF score, BM25, vector distance)
monodex --debug search --text "how to read JSON files"
```

The output preamble names which methods are being queried:

```
Catalog: rushstack / Label: main / Searching: fts, vector
```

Each result header carries a `[v]`, `[f]`, or `[f+v]` marker (introduced in Vocabulary above) indicating which method(s) ranked it. Without the `--retrieval` flag, the search uses every method in the label's retrieval selection; passing `--retrieval` filters within the selection. Asking for a method not in the selection is an error.

### View Full Chunks

```bash
# View a specific chunk by ordinal
monodex view --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62:3

# View a range of chunks
monodex view --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62:2-4

# View from chunk 3 to the end
monodex view --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62:3-end

# View all chunks in a file (reconstruct entire file)
monodex view --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62

# View chunks from multiple files
monodex view --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62:3 --id a1b2c3d4e5f67890:1-2

# Show full filesystem paths
monodex view --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62 --full-paths

# Omit catalog preamble (chunks only)
monodex view --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62 --chunks-only

# Filter by catalog and label
monodex view --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62 --catalog rushstack --label main
```

### Debug Chunking Algorithm

```bash
# See how a file gets chunked (AST-only mode, reveals partitioner issues)
monodex dump-chunks --file ./src/JsonFile.ts

# Include fallback line-based splitting (production behavior)
monodex dump-chunks --file ./src/JsonFile.ts --with-fallback

# Visualize mode - show full chunk contents
monodex dump-chunks --file ./src/JsonFile.ts --visualize

# Debug mode - show partitioning decisions
monodex dump-chunks --file ./src/JsonFile.ts --debug

# Custom target chunk size (default: 6000 chars)
monodex dump-chunks --file ./src/JsonFile.ts --target-size 4000

# Audit chunking quality across multiple files (AST-only mode)
monodex audit-chunks --count 20 --folder /path/to/project
```

**Chunk Quality Score**: 0-100%, higher is better. The score is a maintainer heuristic, not a pass/fail metric. Scores below roughly 85% are worth inspecting; scores below roughly 60% usually indicate tiny chunks, oversized chunks, or severe over-splitting. Note: `dump-chunks` and `audit-chunks` use AST-only mode (fallback disabled) to accurately measure partitioner quality.

### Debug FTS Tokenization

```bash
# Show the tokens the FTS tokenizer produces for a chunk's text
monodex debug-fts --catalog rushstack --label main --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62:3

# Also explain how a query ranks against that chunk
monodex debug-fts --catalog rushstack --label main --id 30440fb2ecd5fa62:3 --query "JsonFile.load"
```

Most "FTS can't find a thing I know is there" cases turn out to be tokenization issues, not ranking issues. The plain `debug-fts` invocation shows what tokens were extracted from the chunk; adding `--query` runs Tantivy's score explanation against the parsed query.

### Purge Data

```bash
# Purge all chunks from a catalog (all labels)
monodex purge --catalog rushstack

# Purge entire database (all catalogs)
monodex purge --all
```

**Note:** `purge` operates at catalog or database scope. There is currently no supported per-label purge command; do not edit database rows by hand.

### Database Management

```bash
# Initialize the database (required before first crawl)
monodex init-db

# Re-run is safe - idempotent if database already exists
monodex init-db

# Recover from a schema-mismatch error: deletes the database and recreates it
monodex init-db --delete-everything
```

`--delete-everything` is the remedy when you upgrade Monodex and your existing database was built against an older schema version. The error message points at this command. All catalogs must be re-crawled afterward; the option is destructive by design.

The database is stored at `~/.monodex/default-db/` by default. You can customize this location via the `database.path` field in config.

### Concurrency

Multiple `monodex` invocations against the same database coordinate via OS-level file locks. Concurrent crawls against the same catalog wait for each other; concurrent crawls against different catalogs run in parallel. Read-only commands (`search`, `view`) acquire no locks and run alongside writers. See `docs/design/concurrency.md` for details.

## Development

For full developer documentation (data model, crawl pipeline, source tree, and links to every other doc in the repo), start at [docs/design/architecture.md](https://github.com/microsoft/monodex/blob/main/docs/design/architecture.md). After making changes, run [docs/smoke_test.md](https://github.com/microsoft/monodex/blob/main/docs/smoke_test.md) to verify the build end-to-end.

When making a pull request, add a bullet under "## Unreleased" in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) describing the change from an end-user perspective. See CHANGELOG.md for the version history and publishing instructions.

Run CI checks using [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) (recommended):

```bash
# Install just
cargo install just

# Run all CI checks: format, clippy, all tests
just ci

# Run quick CI checks: format, clippy, fast tests only (slow tests skipped)
just ci-quick

# Individual commands
just fmt          # Auto-format code
just fmt-check    # Check formatting
just clippy       # Run lints
just test         # Run all tests
just test-quick   # Run tests excluding slow ones
just build        # Build release binary
```

Use `just ci-quick` during iteration. Run `just ci` before declaring work complete, and at any intermediate point worth a deeper check. See the "Quick CI tier" section of [docs/code_organization_policy.md](docs/code_organization_policy.md) for the policy.

Or run directly with cargo:

```bash
# Run all CI checks
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --locked
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked

# Build
cargo build --release

# Run with logging (use sparo for testing, not rushstack)
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/monodex crawl --catalog sparo --label main --commit HEAD
```

## Crawl Configuration

The crawl behavior (which files to index and how to chunk them) can be customized via configuration files.

For the full inventory of files Monodex reads or writes (config-folder state, the database folder layout, repo-local config files), see [docs/design/monodex_files.md](https://github.com/microsoft/monodex/blob/main/docs/design/monodex_files.md).

### Config Discovery

Configs are loaded in this precedence order:

1. `<repo-root>/monodex-crawl.json` (repo-local)
2. `~/.monodex/monodex-crawl-config.json` (user-global)
3. Embedded default (compiled into binary)

No merging occurs. Exactly one config is used.

### Config Schema

JSON schemas are available in the `schemas/` folder for IDE autocomplete and validation. Reference the appropriate schema in your config file via the `$schema` field:

| Config File               | Schema File                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `monodex-config.json`     | `schemas/config.schema.json`  |
| `monodex-crawl.json`      | `schemas/crawl.schema.json`   |
| `monodex-crawl-config.json` | `schemas/crawl.schema.json` |
| `monodex-state.json`      | `schemas/context.schema.json` |

Create a `monodex-crawl.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "fileTypes": {
    ".ts": "typescript",
    ".tsx": "typescript",
    ".md": "markdown",
    ".yaml": "lineBased"
  },
  "patternsToExclude": [
    "node_modules/",
    "dist/",
    "build/",
    "**/*.test.ts",
    "**/*.spec.ts"
  ],
  "patternsToKeep": ["src/", "test/"]
}
```

**Fields:**

| Field               | Type   | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `version`           | number | Must be `1`                              |
| `fileTypes`         | object | Maps file extension to chunking strategy |
| `patternsToExclude` | array  | Glob patterns for paths to skip          |
| `patternsToKeep`    | array  | Glob patterns that override exclusions   |

**Chunking strategies:**

| Strategy     | Description                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `typescript` | AST-based semantic chunking (TS/TSX) |
| `markdown`   | Split by heading hierarchy           |
| `lineBased`  | Generic line-based chunking          |

**Evaluation rule:**

```text
shouldCrawl = matchesFileType && (matchesPatternsToKeep || !matchesPatternsToExclude)
```

- `fileTypes` is the primary filter. Unsupported file types are never crawled.
- `patternsToKeep` overrides `patternsToExclude` (useful for keeping test files in `src/`)
- Folder patterns (ending in `/`) match anywhere in the path

**Pattern syntax:**

- Glob patterns use the standard syntax: `**` for recursive, `*` for wildcard
- Folder patterns end with `/` (e.g., `node_modules/`)
- Example: `**/*.test.ts` matches test files at any depth
