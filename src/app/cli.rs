//! CLI argument definitions using clap.
//!
//! Purpose: Define command-line interface types (Cli, Commands, CrawlSourceArgs).
//! Edit here when: Adding new CLI flags, commands, or changing help text.
//! Do not edit here for: Command handler logic (see commands/), config loading (see config.rs).
